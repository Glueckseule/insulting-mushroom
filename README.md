# The Offensive Mushroom

It's a page just for fun. Basically, you can click a button and the mushroom insults you. 
You can choose between soft, hard and bavarian offense. 

# Data

The data come from a mushroom lexicon, the information is transformed to a json with python. 
The json file contains mushrooms with meta information and an array with adjectives to enhance the offense.

# Images

To make the page more visually appealing, I created some mushroom SVGs and animated them. The idea for these mushrooms though comes from eni-art. 

# Get offended

Currently, the page only runs locally on my computer with xampp. Not on any server yet.
